# my-mount

A Leiningen template for mount-based projects.

## Usage

Clone the repo.

Inside the repo: `lein jar`

Then: `lein install`

Then, when creating a new project: `lein new my-mount name-of-project`

When running this project, while inside its directory: 

```
lein repl

(user) => (dev)

... download dependencies and compile code ...

(dev) => (go)

```

### After changing some code:

### If the code doesn't compile:
```
(dev) => (refresh)
```
